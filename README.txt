WHAT TO RUN: 
	
	To run the application, run the file called BracketMatchAppTest.java



DESCRIPTION :

    	This application takes as input from the commandline a string and tells the user whether the brackets and parenthesis are matched up. 
It also attempts to tell the user which bracket is the problem. 



DESCRIPION OF MAJOR CLASSES AND METHODS: 
        I have a node class which is used in my Stack class since I have a Stack of nodes. I then have the class called BracketTest.java which 
takes care of all the logic behind the application so that the BracketMatchAppTest just sets up the questions for the user and uses the BracketTest
class to solve the problem. 
	

WAYS TO IMPROVE: 
	
	Currently, the identification of which bracket is wrong is a bit off. I would like to go back and try to fine tune this.
